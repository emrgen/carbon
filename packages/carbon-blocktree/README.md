# Blocktree implementation for Carbon

Process transactions and update the block tree in client applications.

Transactions applied to client and server finally produces the same block tree.

The implementation is somewhat similar to the CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) concept.

Blocktree implementation paves the way for future CRDT implementation and usage.
